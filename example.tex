    Low-temperature plasma sources have wide ranges of applications such as in electric propulsion, thin film deposition and particle sources for accelerators. As the behavior of such plasmas is strongly correlated to electron properties, reliable diagnostics able to probe electron properties are needed. Access to these information would help to increase our understanding of the physics of such complex plasma sources and validate predictive simulations under development$^{[1]}$.

   In this work, our objective is to develop a new highly-sensitive and compact Incoherent Thomson Scattering (ITS) diagnostic for the measurement of electron properties in different low temperature plasma sources with the spatial and temporal resolution required.
%In this work we prove that Incoherent Thomson scattering measurements using a monochromator and Volume Bragg Grating based Notch Filters (VBG-NF) can compete with the performance obtained with Triple Grating Spectrometer (TGS). Electron properties measurement with spatial resolution down to $0.3 \ \mu m$ and temporal measurement with resolution down to $15 ns$ were performed on cathode and magnetron sources exhibiting temperature ranging from $0.5 \ eV$ to $20 \ eV$ and electron density from $10^{16} \ m^{-3}$ to $10^{18} \ m^{-3}$.

    ITS methods involves the analysis of scattered photons by free charged particles (electrons in our study) at length scales smaller than the Debye length. Averaged over the scattering volume and the solid angle of observation, the scattered photon spectral intensity measured in the case of Maxwell-Boltzmann Electron Velocities Distribution Function (EVDF) can be expressed as:
    \begin{equation}
    I_{T}(\lambda,\Delta \lambda_{g}, \lambda_{0},n_{e})=c_{1}n_{e} P_{i}L\delta \lambda \frac{d \sigma_{T}}{d \Omega}(\theta, \phi) \left( \frac{e^{- \frac{(\lambda-\lambda_{0})^{2}}{2 \Delta \lambda_{g}^{2}}}}{\Delta \lambda_{g} \sqrt{2 \pi}} \ast I \right) (\lambda)

        %the laser power: the length of the scattering volume: the wavelength width covered by each pixel of the detector, 
    With $c_{1}$ the total transmission factor obtained after a Raman calibration, $P_{i} L \delta \lambda$ some known experimental parameters,  $\frac{d \sigma_{T}}{d \Omega}(\theta, \phi)= r_{e}^{2}(1-sin^{2}\theta cos^{2} \phi)$ the differential Thomson scattering cross section along the observation direction and $I(\lambda)$ the normed instrument function. From a fitting of the scattered photons spectral intensity  the electron density ($n_{e}$) is directly obtained, $\Delta \lambda_{g}$ gives the electron temperature ($T_{e}$) and $\lambda_{0}-\lambda_{i}$ the electron drift velocity ($v_{e,drift}$).
    
    In case of Thomson signals with high signal to noise ratio, the Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF) can be extracted from the normed derivative of the spectral intensity$^{[2]}$: $f_{E}(E) \propto \frac{dI}{d\lambda}$ with $E=\frac{m_{e}}{2} \cdot \frac{c (\lambda-\lambda_{0})}{2 \lambda_{i} sin(\theta/2)}$.

A new highly-sensitive ITS diagnostic has been successfully developed and applied  for electron property measurement in low-temperature plasmas. Electron properties measurements by ITS have been obtained for the first time in a Hall thruster cathode and a planar magnetron with spatial resolution of $ 0.3 \mu m$ and temporal resolution of $15 \ n s$.
